Hello, yesterday, the 11th of February, 2026, at 7:27 AM, I decided to leave the Discord platform. I spent the day searching for alternatives and found [Stoat](https://stoat.chat).

# Why are you leaving Discord?

I've been considering leaving off and on for some time, but recently Discord expanded their age verification requirements, and it's not the verification itself that concerns me; rather, it's just the fact that I

have to verify my face or ID to a company that has gotten their data stolen with complete ease. I'm just not very comfortable sharing any form of biometric data with any company that has previously experienced data breaches.

I hate the lies Discord just feeds to their own platform, expecting us to ignore the big obvious red flags right next to them.

# What will you be doing on Discord after you move?

I will continue using Discord as I currently do until the 23rd of February 2026. After that date, I will use it only for work purposes. If a project I'm involved in gets cancelled, I'll be leaving, and if I get a DM, I likely won't respond.
